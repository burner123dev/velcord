## Installing

Visit https://velcord.dev/install

## Building from Source

You need to have the following dependencies installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- pnpm: `npm install --global pnpm`

Packaging will create builds in the dist/ folder

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Velcord/Velcord
cd Velcord

# Install Dependencies
pnpm i

# Either run it without packaging
pnpm start

# Or package (will build packages for your OS)
pnpm package

# Or only build the Linux Pacman package
pnpm package --linux pacman

# Or package to a directory only
pnpm package:dir
```

## Building LibVesktop from Source

This is a small C++ helper library Velcord uses on Linux to emit D-Bus events. By default, prebuilt binaries for x64 and arm64 are used.

If you want to build it from source:
1. Install build dependencies:
    - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install build-essential python3 curl pkg-config libglib2.0-dev`
    - Fedora: `dnf install @c-development @development-tools python3 curl pkgconf-pkg-config glib2-devel`
2. Run `pnpm buildLibVesktop`
3. From now on, building Velcord will use your own build
